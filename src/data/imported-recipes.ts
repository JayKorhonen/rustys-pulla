Add the milk, cover, and continue cooking until the milk is completely absorbed and the rice is soft and creamy. Preheat oven to 450°F Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. For the Pastry: In a medium-sized bowl, combine the water, salt, and rye and white flours to make a stiff dough. Shape the dough into a log and cut into 16 portions and shape each into a round. On a lightly floured board, roll out each round into a 6-inch circle. Spread about 3 tablespoons of filling evenly on each round. Fold two opposite edges of the pastry over the filling and crimp the edges of the dough toward the center to make an oval-shaped pastry, allowing about 1/2-inch of the crust to overlay the filling and leaving the center of the filling exposed. Place on the prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, stir together the melted butter and hot milk and brush on the pastries. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, brushing once during baking, until the pastries are golden on the edges. Remove from the oven and brush again. For the Egg Butter:. In a small bowl, cream the butter. Stir in the eggs. Season with the white pepper and ground ginger, if desired. Yield: 1 cup. Cool the pastries and serve with the egg butter at room temperature.',
